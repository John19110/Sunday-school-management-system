# Sunday School Management System API

Backend system built with **ASP.NET Core Web API** for managing Sunday schools in churches.

This project is part of my backend engineering portfolio and demonstrates building a real-world system using layered architecture, authentication, authorization, and database management.

## 🚀 About The Project

Churches need an organized way to manage:

- Students
- Servants (teachers)
- Classes & stages
- Attendance
- User permissions

This API provides secure and scalable endpoints to handle those operations.
